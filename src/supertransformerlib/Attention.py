    Parameter Injection Memory Unit. (PIMU)

    Parameter Memory are large blocks of parameters
    which are compatible with an embedded stream
    as though they are embeddings themselves.

    The process of Parameter Injection is a process
    of conditionally injecting whole blocks of parameters,
    into a running embedded stream as though it were an
    embedding itself. Two tasks exist. First, the module
    must figure out what parameter block to inject, and
    when. Second, the module must train the parameter
    blocks to provide useful context.

    The location of best effect for parameter injection
    is within a model of some sort that is mapping many
    inputs onto only a few results, at some point in
    the logic of the process. This may exist in a
    transformer unit, a imagenet flow, or even just
    a standard dense network.

    For high granulaty, a high head count and softmax mode
    are desirable. In this case many options are considered
    avaibable. For a case in which only a few options should
    be allowed at each step, a low head count is recommmended.
    Generally, it is recommended to start with a high head
    count where possible; more heads does NOT slow the
    model down.

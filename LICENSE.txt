Credit:

    Credit for the development of this library must not be falsely represented as performed by anyone but
     the author and/or maintainers.

Academic Exception:

    Parameter injection (PI) is henceforth the idea of feeding a self-attending transformer with a block of parameters
    rather than data from a tensor stream. Global-Local work division is the idea of splitting the attention
    process up into a local banded attention, and a network of global attention to reduce computational burden.
    Transformer specialization is the concept of using parameter injection with ensembles and many subheads on the
    PIMU and PISU stream to allow granular but controllable subcatagorization of inputs in the tensor stream. Global
    Strategy is the concept of using a PI based fixed width tensor to examine the trends seen at a global level, irregardless
    of context.

    The concepts of Parameter Injection, Global-Local work division, Transformer Specialization, and Global Strategizing as
    existing within a single transformer model may not, without prior notification or independent development, be placed within
    a single model for academic publishment without the inclusion of the author of this library.

    Should an individual wish to coauthor a paper, or use the library for such purposes, the author would be more
    than happy to discuss the situation at chrisoquinn.2@gmail.com

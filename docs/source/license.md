## False Representation of Authorship:

Credit for the development of this library must not be falsely represented as performed by anyone but
    the author and/or maintainers. Any user of this library may not falsely
    represent themselves as having developed the code or concept of this library
    in a commercial or academic environment solely by themselves. 
     
* **Okay**: Our team put together a machine learning model out of open source code with amazing properties.
* **Okay**: Our company customized ML model which will serve all your needs. We will offer support as well.
* **Forbidden**: Our team developed from scratch a library with the following property

## Academic Exception:

Long story short, do not scoop me. I need this
to break into academics.

*Condition*

The usage of **PI** within the literature of the machine learning context is likely to come out soon, as it is a fairly simple development of the transformer system.
Other such developments I have been aiming for, such as banded processing, certainly have. Nonetheless,
a combination of these developments does have a reasonable condition.

Except for the application and restrictions of local and federal law, the publication, presentation, or academic discussion of a system implimenting at least **four**
of the seven defined concepts and directly inspired by thing library and associated documentation
may not be performed without the notification, citation, and consent of the author, "Christopher M O'Quinn",
to the usage of the concepts in such a manner. 

*Permission and Mentoring*

Should a researcher wish to publish a paper or analysis on such a topic, feel
free to contact me at chrisoquinn.2@gmail.com. I would love to contribute to a 
paper and get some mentoring of some sort.

This condition expires on 1/1/2025, excepting any legal liabilities or
violations which occurred while this condition is operational.
